    <h1>Typography Sample Page</h1>
    <p>
      Typography is the is the art and technique of arranging type to make
      written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed.
      <em>[Wikipedia]</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      For web pages, typography is controlled through CSS (Cascading Style
      Sheets). These allow one to select an appropriate font family, size,
      style, weight and so on, for each element.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>font family</strong> selects a visual design for each
      character or glyph. Some designs, such as "Times New Roman" have little
      'hooks' or 'serifs' on each letter. Some, such as "Indie Flower" are
      designed to resemble hand writing and are called 'cursive'.
