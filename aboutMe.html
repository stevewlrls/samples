      Hi! My name is Luke. This is a picture of me on an old bridge, near my
      home. I was drawing a picture of my house, while my teddy, Bozer, watched.
      Bozer doesn't say very much but he listens really well, and it's good to
      explain to him what I am doing. He always understands.

      This is my dog, Freddy. He's a Lakeland Terrier - I think. He loves
      running and chasing things, so he only goes off his lead like this when we
      know it's safe. I don't think he'd hurt any other animals, but you never
      know.
