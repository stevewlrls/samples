      It is a dark and stormy night. Up on the hilltop, the jagged lightning
      reveals a massive castle. On the road leading up to it, a black coach is
      being drawn by four horses, their hooves clattering on the stones and
      throwing sparks from their iron shoes.

      As the coach gets close to the castle, a massive gate opens in two halves,
      allowing the horse to clatter through to a courtyard in front of the keep.
      There is no coachman to drive the coach, but the horses seem to know what
      they are doing. They slow down as they enter the castle, and the coach
      comes to a stop right by the steps to the main door.

      Lightning flashes again, and just then a heavy rain begins to drench
      everything below the ominous clouds. The coach door opens and a young man
      steps out. <em>(To be continued...)</em>
